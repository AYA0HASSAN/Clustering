# Clustering
applying Different Clustering Techniques {K_mean , DBSCAN , Agglomerative , GaussianMixture } 
the purpose of that project is to Cluster Customer Dataset int 4 Clusters :
  0-Earn High,Spend High
  1-Earn High,Spend Low
  2-Earn Low ,Spend High
  3-Earn Low ,Spend Low
I used 'Customer Data.csv' from Kaggel
and used 4- different clustering algorithms with PCA for enhancing each model performance 
at the end I compared all the algorithms and the best was K mean
